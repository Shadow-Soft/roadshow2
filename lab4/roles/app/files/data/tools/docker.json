    "description": "Docker uses LXC to create and manage native, sandboxed virtual containers. LXC containers acts like a separate OSes, can install their own packages without affecting anything else, and overall have almost the same flexibility of VMs but without any of the virtualization overhead!  Docker adds a ton of features, like an elegant configuration file that automates many things (like port forwarding, disk/directory mounting, networking, etc), a way to create and share readymade images that can be distributed as appliances, etc.",
